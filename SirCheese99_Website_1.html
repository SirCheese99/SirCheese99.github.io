<h1>
This is my website
</h1>
<p>
I made this to help enhance my programming skills, but also to boost my youtube channel. I wil probably use this as a blog, or make a new one and use that at a blog instead. 
</p>
<p>
Maybe you should subscribe to my youtube channel... it wouldn't be a bad idea...
</p>
<p>
Also I love animating, arts & crafts,playing video games, and more!
</p>
<p>
It will mainly be about new videos to post, and i will try and figure out how to add a comment/chat box on this also.
